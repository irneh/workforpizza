Since we now have only
[8 seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_span#Length_of_the_span) to
focus tonight I'll, uh, what, oh yea, take it easy on myself and simply link to
strangely (are you still with me?) strangely related writings and leave the rest
to the reader.

- Rather impenetrable for general audiences:
  [What Programming Language Should I Learn?](http://madhadron.com/a-rant-about-what-programming-language-should-i-learn)
  You can read the first part for sure.

- Too long and disquieting for general audiences: [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html).
  You can read all of this. It's a question of what you're willing to take away.

- Apparently irrelevant but uplifting for general audiences: [I am making one website a day for 180 days](http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com/post/56319597560/im-learning-to-code-by-building-180-websites-in-180).

1 of these is quite unlike the others. Their axes meet, though, eventually.
