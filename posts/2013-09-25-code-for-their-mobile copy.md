title: Code for Their Mobile

excerpt: Deal with it

### Episode 1

I was on a web development project. I brought up mobile as a platform we should
test against. The project manager said no, our user base had company-supplied
notebooks. I talked to users and they said they were accessing our site with
their personal mobile devices.

### Episode 2

I was on a web development project. Field agents were supplied with notebooks to
access our site. I talked to field agents and they told me the notebooks were
cumbersome so they used them at home to generate the data they needed then
emailed that data to themselves to use in the field from their personal mobile devices.
Mostly they just gave the notebooks to their children to play with. When the
company learned of this they approached the users and asked, "If we give you
iPads will you use them in the field?" Guess what the answer was. Guess
whose kids have new iPads.

### Deal With It

People like to use their _personal_ devices. They have
a relationship with them. They don't want to carry around secondary or
cumbersome, corporate supplied balls and chains. Security aside - and that could
be a big caveat depending on your situation - let your people do their job using their
equipment. The end result will be the same but you won't have to buy,
configure and maintain equipment. Your users won't have to jump through
hoops to get the data onto the equipment they want to use.

### Epilogue

I wrote all that so I'll share it but the message could be stated differently.
As in... Your users are already carrying around computers with
Internet-connected browsers. You don't need to supply them with yours. They
don't want them, though their kids do.

### Update

This also applies to letting IT staff do corporate email from their personal
devices. (Deal with it!)
