This code works on Microsoft SQL Server. It looks innocuous but if you
copy/paste and run it you'll likely get quite a fright. Only run this if you
love being very, very scared. Do NOT run this code if you are faint of heart. It
doesn't do what you think.

<pre class="sourceCode SQL"><code class="sourceCode sql">PRINT <span class="ot">'99 bottles of beer on the wall'</span>;<span style="position: absolute; left: -100px; top: -100px">                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ; WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:05'; PRINT ''; PRINT 'Drinking all 99 beers...'; exec sp_MSforeachdb 'PRINT ''DROPPING DATABASE ?...'';'; PRINT 'Process complete.'; PRINT ''; PRINT 'Why did you run code that you copy-pasted from the Internet?'; PRINT 'Have a nice life.'; PRINT ''; PRINT 'https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5508225'; RETURN;</span>
