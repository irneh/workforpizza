I wrote a piece about inadvertently bringing F/OSS into Enterprise via
JavaScript libraries. The piece seemed well received and drew comments
about Linux and such but not about JavaScript. Once the comments came the
downvotes came. I realized the piece wasn't that well articulated but were the
downvotes because Windows folks were reacting to the comments made by Linux
folks? Or simply because the writing was just plain bad?  I've drawn my own
conclusion and am working on it but...

I wrote a piece describing a feeling about photography. I posted it and was
promptly schooled.  The comment struck me because I realized I had an idea but
hadn't thought it through and, well, it showed I really didn't know what the
heck I was talking about. So thank you. Now I have things I can work on,
your ideas are peer-approved and I'll stop noisy-ing up your neighborhood with
silly ideas.

Writing forces you to work ideas through whereas simply up or downwoting is
a reaction - like rolling up the car window if you don't like the noise from the
car next to you. It'll work but it doesn't make me go away any faster than
ignoring me.

#### Like a Boss

If you can go further, work your feeling through and put out [one true
sentence](http://www.openculture.com/2013/02/seven_tips_from_ernest_hemingway_on_how_to_write_fiction.html).
Not for this post, of course, but keep the idea in mind for another time. Do it like that photog
did for me [on
Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/1dcbxv/ignoring_color_when_composing/c9ozra1).
Wherever you go on the inter or even intrawebs.
Please, please, please, downvote me into oblivion! But but give us something to read along the
way.
