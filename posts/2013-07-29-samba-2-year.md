I've now worn these shoes for 730 days, or 2 years. Recently, they
were there for me when...

Hitching a ride and saving a few miles of desert hiking. The [San Rafael Reef](https://scoot.io/go/847) is in the background:

The shoes survived yet another day but yet another pair of socks did not:

Shopping for beer in Utah. Beer sucks in Utah so why pretend?
High-Life it:

Playing with falcons. That meat is for them:

Taking a bus tour of Hong Kong:

Helping lay a new sewer line:

Relaxing alone above the crowd. The snow-capped mountains in the background are
the [La Sals](https://scoot.io/go/126):

#### Post-mortem?

These shoes are not ready to give up the ghost but it's been 2 years already.
And I have a spare set! I don't think I'm ready to commit to 3+ more years with
these things but I'll keep you posted ;)
