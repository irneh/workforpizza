I got this email from my gal today:

> GUI and you don't have to do things command line.

It takes less than that to get me going! :)

GUIs are good for __discovery__. They are good when you don't know what you are
doing or don't know what to do it with. I know from personal experience. In the
mid-nineties I set up an email server (Exchange) for my family business. I'd
never heard of [mail
agents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mail_agent_(infrastructure)) or any such
thing. I just popped in the Microsoft Small Business Server CD (note: not a DVD)
and clicked "Install." When it was done, not knowing what to do, I just clicked
on the "Start" menu and found the new entries. Before long I found myself in an
Exchange console and kept on clicking around, opening panes and dialogs and
sub-dialogs and so forth. After a lot of trial and error I got email working,
inbound and eventually outbound. I didn't know what I'd done or or if I'd done
it correctly. But there was an effect; something was happening.  To be clear, I
didn't know what I'd needed to do or what I was trying to build but with
persistence I found my way to an end.

Interlude: Who doesn't love the [Postfix](http://www.postfix.org/) mascot?

I've used Postfix without problem for years so please do.

Oh. But where was I?
Ah, yes. I've managed MSSQL systems for ~15 years. I've also managed
MySQL and PostgreSQL systems.  Managing database servers with a GUI, whether
it's with SSMS or pgAdmin, involves a lot of interaction with a pane on the left
that's essentially an iFrame. Getting, say, a list of tables can be a hassle
when you do it all day long. Just ask your DBA to show you how it's done in the
GUI. It's slow and tedious. On the other hand, doing the same thing against
MySQL from the command line is a lot simpler:

    SHOW TABLES;

You just type that and hit ENTER. That's fewer keystrokes than GUI mouse-clicks
and I can do them with my eyes closed. With PostgreSQL they made it, well, simpler
still:

    \dt

Yes. That's it. That "\\dt" means DESCRIBE TABLES.
Since I know _what_ I need to do and _how_ to do it I'll take


    \dt

over playing point-and-click/click-and-drag/whack-a-mole with the GUI.

To be fair, and go on a tangent, I got into SQL not in school but thanks to MS
Access. I created much with its graphical designer. But before long I needed
more of its SQL engine; things that weren't presented or weren't possible in the
GUI. But things it could indeed do. The GUI got me started. It was there to help me
__discover__.  Regarding going past what the GUI can do, I'll just leave you
with [What You See Is All You Get](http://danwin.com/2012/08/wysiayg-all/).

...

PS. Wasn't this supposed to be about command line interactions? I got off-track.
Unfortunately for you I just woke up and we are continuing:

    ifconfig

Now please use your Windows/Mac/Boobuntu GUI to show me the IP and MAC addresses
for each of your network interfaces, along with their MTUs. Unfair example?
Sorry. It's just the first that comes to mind.

I think the command line is similar. You need to know what you're doing before
you begin composing. There is no "undo" at the command line.

    sleep 14400
