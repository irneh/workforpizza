In contrast to Gartner numbers published by
[CNET](http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-10098624-92.html) (2008) and the [Harvard
Business
Review](http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/03/open_source_software_hits_a_st.html)
(2011)
my experience has been that most enterprise shops - mid-sized business and
government - have an aversion to open source software, especially the free
kind.

It's probably the region I work in and it's often
[FUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt) - "Who'll support
it if it breaks? It's less secure because people can read the code. How do I
know it's not sending my data to another country?"
When people I work with say this, for fun, I challenge them. I've asked for copies of
governance or procurement policies that mandate closed source solutions but
have never seen them. "Trust me," they say, "That might work for Twitter but we
have [insert acronym] data."

I think this behavior is a teeny-bit rooted in fanboi-ism but primarily in the
intrinsic need to justify choices made and, well, an employee's general
existence. If a Windows admin hears of Linux the reaction is often defensive.
Tell a BSD admin that Windows is needed for something and the reaction may be
worse.
This behavior is strongest in management since being seen as having
made the wrong choice or supported the wrong camp can lead to termination.

#### Javascript

Yes, JS is what's going to crease a lot of brows and crinkle a lot of faces.
Open source software has been flooding in through the front door via jQuery,
Bootstrap, Boilerplate, and much, much more.

Your database may be Oracle on Sun but you're sending all that
data over the wire to an application running open source software.
"Worse" yet is that your devs may be linking to public CDNs like Google's. Now
your [insert acronym] data is being processed by open source code that is served by
a third party!

While the FUD is greatest within operations teams and their management it's less
so within development teams - the ones who are either unwittingly or eagerly
bringing this stuff in. Accidental or not I think this move toward using open
source projects will continue and organizations will be better off in the end,
once they figure things out. I can hear a dam bursting nearby.
